If you have a question for the Executive Committee, please use email <a href="mailto:website@wwcca/ca">website@wwcca.ca </a>to submit it and someone will respond to you directly and it may even end up on this page!</p><p><strong>Q: Who is our contact at Ministry of Transportation for any local roadwork?</strong></p><p>A: If you have any questions or concern about this recent work or future planned work, our contact at MTO is Gerry Parent from Cochrane 705-­272-­7559 as of April 1, 2014.</p><p><strong>Q: When will the annual WWCCA meeting be held and where? </strong></p><p>A: See the home page. Annual Meeting details are provided there when available.</p><p><strong>Q: Is there a way to find out water levels for Watabeag Lake?</strong></p><p>A: Water levels are measured periodically at the Watabeag Control Dam (manually) and would be available through the local Ministry of Natural Resources, Kirkland Lake Regional Office, Craig Fuller 568-3225.</p><p><strong>Q: Is there a swimmers itch issue at the lakes?</strong></p><p>​​A: During the 2015 annual meeting, a member indicated that swimmers itch was experienced at Watabeag Lake. MNRF, in attendance during the meeting indicated that this issue is driven by warmer weather and bird droppings (where aquatic snails and birds act as hosts for schistosomes, a free-swimming larvae of parasites that cause an allergic reaction; the swimmers itch rash). Upon further research, <a href="https://sandbox.square.online/app/website/editor-frame/faq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="" class="w-quill-link" data-type="external" data-link="{&quot;external&quot;:&quot;http://www.swimmersitch.ca/&quot;}" data-tab="true">http://www.swimmersitch.ca</a>, it appears that there were several reports of swimmers itch in Northern Ontario in 2015 (see risk map provided at the link above). This website also appreciates notification of any observation of swimmers itch across Canada, therefore members are encouraged to provide this notification if they experience swimmers itch again at Watabeag or Wildgoose Lakes.</p><p><strong>Q: Recent forestry efforts in the area?</strong></p><p>A: There are very clear and quite stringent guidelines regarding forestry practices and these are regularly monitored. Occasionally cottagers raise concerns about clear cutting near our cottages. The only effective way we can deal with this type of issue is to have representation on the local Forestry Planning committees. These committees occasionally request applications to participate and the WWCCA could look into putting a member forward for consideration in the future, as resources allow.</p><p><strong>Q: Illegal dumping at the landfill issues?</strong></p><p>A:  Please contact MNRF at their 24-7 tip line with license plate of any illegal dumping activities observed (take a picture if you can) 1-877-847-7667.</p><p>MNRF has taken on full operation of the landfill site starting in August 2016, with hours of operation changed to one day per week. Eventually a pay system will be set up. Continuing through 2024 no payment fees are being taken.  As of 2024 newsletter, hours of operation are Sunday (11 am – 7pm) - beginning of May until the end of October.</p><p><strong>Q: Recycling available in the area?</strong></p><p>A: In the past, WWCCA has provided one recycling bin at the landfill. The MNRF are now in full control of landfill operations and there is typically places to recycle your waste, rather than placing in the trench. Please observe and obey the signage.  Recycling helps extend the lifespan of the landfill by reducing the amount of waste being deposited. Lets all do our part.</p><p><strong>Q: Bear control issues?</strong></p><p>A: We can only advise cottagers of what we are told by the MNRF: </p><p>1. report nuisance bears to the 24h Bear Watch Hotline 1-866-514-2327 (operational April 1st to October 31st).</p><p>2. if safety of humans is involved call the OPP (911).</p><p><strong>Q. Can lethal force be used to dispatch a bear?</strong></p><p>​A: <em>From MNRF <a href="https://sandbox.square.online/app/website/editor-frame/faq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="" class="w-quill-link" data-type="external" data-link="{&quot;external&quot;:&quot;https://www.ontario.ca/page/report-bear-problem-bear-wise&quot;}" data-tab="true">website </a>(dated October 2015):</em></p><p><em>Lethal force (dispatch a bear)It’s best to prevent encounters with bears in the first place.</em></p><p><em>But if a bear continues to be a problem — and you’ve exhausted all other alternatives — as a property owner, you have the right to protect your personal property and yourself.</em></p><p><em>Any action you take must be:</em></p><ul><li><em>carried out with the most humane means possible</em></li><li><em>done in a safe manner</em></li><li><em>in accordance with any applicable laws (e.g., discharging a firearm by-laws)</em></li></ul><p><em>You do not need a hunting licence. But if you kill a black bear, you must report it immediately to your local Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry office.</em></p><p><em>If you want to keep the dead animal for personal use, you must register for what’s called a Notice of Possession with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.</em></p><p><strong><em>It is strongly advised that killing a bear in self-defence be an action of last resort.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Q: Issues with snowplowing during winter months?</strong></p><p>A: Snowplowing efforts are undertaken through the direction of the Watabeag Roads Board. </p><p><strong>Q: What is the status for hydro power at the lakes?</strong></p><p>A: The WWCCA feels that this is not a current mandate of the executive. This had been a "hot" topic in the early 1990s, however since then many cottagers have invested heavily in solar, wind and generator power. The costs of the power lines into the two lakes would have increased significantly since the early 1990s and at the time when the cost would have been much lower, only a fraction of the 150 cottagers required to sign up were interested.</p><p>Q: What is the status of fish stocking (walleye) at Watabeag Lake?</p><p>A: The MNRF still hasn't changed their solid opposition to any fish stocking of walleye in Watabeag Lake. </p><p><strong>Q: Can you tell me about fish stocking in the area?</strong></p><p>A: The MNRF would like information on stocked lakes that are not producing fishing results. If you have information let the WWCCA executive know and we will forward it along to the appropriate staff at MNRF. </p><p>​<strong>Q: What can be done about soap/washing activities impacting the lake?</strong></p><p>A: Concerns have been raised regarding the use of soap in and around our lakes and impacts that it may cause. There are several excellent articles available on the internet that can be referenced for best management practices to use in and around our lakes, to help maintain the water quality that we all enjoy. Remember when purchasing cleaning products, to make certain they are phosphate free. The WWCCA executive has looked into existing water testing programs conducted by the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) and the need for any further water quality testing. Several cottagers had stepped forward in the past to participate in the MECP Lake Partner Program, which involves taking a set of water samples in May and accessing clarity throughout the summer season at specific locations on both lakes. Please contact the WWCCA executive if you are interested in participating. Results to date are provided on the MECP Lake Partner Program website.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the Watabeag - Wildgoose Local Roads Board Jurisdiction?</strong></p><p>A: The roads board encompasses the areas from: Pike Lake to Beaver Road, including the following artery roads: Wildgoose, Campground, Old Foggie, Bouchard, and Beaver Lake Road.</p><p>From Matheson to Pike Lake, is the jurisdiction of the Corporation of the Town of Matheson. South of Beaver Lake Road to Hwy 66, is the responsibility of MNRF. The Watabeag-Wildgoose Local Roads board has absolutely no maintenance responsibility or these sections of roadway.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on February 16, 2025</p></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://wwcca.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://wwcca.ca/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
