Each Cottage Watch member plays an important role in promoting the safety and security of cottage country and the programs success is dependent on community involvement and their cooperation with the OPP. Our Cottage Watch Steward is currently unfilled. This person would serve as a contact for our members and the OPP. Cottage Watch window decals have been distributed in the past and if you never got one or need a new one, please contact the WWCCA executive.
